I walked through the tutorial here to get this bubble map started:
[Bubble Map Tutorial](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bubble-map/#initializing)

## Environment set up:

Open your terminal.
Navigate to where you want to save the file final_dv_project and run these commands:

`git clone https://github.com/3mi1y/FinalDataVizProject.git final_dv_project`

`cd final_dv_project`

`npm install`

`node index.js`

After you have run these commands open your browser and visit localhost:3000


FYI - if you don't have node installed on your machine you can use homebrew to install it really easily, npm comes bundled with node. If not, google how to install node on your computer.
