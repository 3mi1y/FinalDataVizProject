This is just a starting point for our code. I walked through the tutorial here to get this bubble map set up:
[Bubble Map Tutorial](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/bubble-map/#initializing)

I have all of this code working now, at least look through the tutorial but you guys don't need to actually code along. All you should have to do is clone this repo, run an npm install in the root directory of this projects folder, visit localhost:3000 in your browser and you are off to the races!

FYI - if you don't have node installed on your machine you can use homebrew to install it really easily, npm comes bundled with node. If not, google how to install node on your computer.
